                <p class="homepart1content">It’s been established that accessibility is good for business, but what does the law say?</p> 
                <p class="homepart1content">The Disability and Discrimination Act 2005 states that it’s unlawful to make it unreasonably difficult for a disabled person to use a service. The Equality Act 2010 adds that disabled people should have equal access to education, employment, goods, services, facilities and transport. Service providers had to make changes (known as ‘reasonable adjustments’) to ensure their facilities were suitable once the act became law. </p>    
                <p class="homepart1content"> Thermae Spa in Bath is one example. It’s on a site with several listed buildings, so they installed lifts wherever possible and ramps where renovations are restricted. The beds in their treatment rooms can be raised or lowered accordingly, there are hoists, assisted seating, and shallow step access into the pools, and their signs are tactile and written in Braille. Private changing rooms for wheelchair users are available. Local accessibility group, Access Bath, gave feedback throughout the process to ensure facilities were suitable.</p>  
            </div>
            <div class="intropart1contentpart2">
                <p class="intropart1content">Despite these measures, accessibility problems are still an issue throughout the country. Facilities such as toilets and changing rooms in high street shopping complexes aren’t always adequate, while unsuitable parking facilities, public transport, and routes in town centres restrict ease of movement. In some cases, they may deter disabled people from visiting a place at all.</p>
